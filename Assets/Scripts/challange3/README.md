You are given a range of integer numbers [a, b] (inclusive), you should return a list of all integers in that range sorted in lexicographical order (i.e. the way they would be listed in the dictionary if written in English).

# Examples:

`a=0, b=5, return [5, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0] # [‘five’, ‘four’, ‘one’, ‘three’, ‘two’, ‘zero’]`

`a=7, b=12, return [8, 11, 9, 7, 10, 12] # [‘eight’, ‘eleven’, ‘nine’, ‘seven’, ‘ten’, ‘twelve’]`

`a=75, b=84, return [80, 84, 81, 83, 82, 78, 75, 79, 77, 76]`

Some details deliberately left undefined, such as:
Range of a and b
Hyphenation and how to correctly spell out large multi-word numbers
For an additional challenge, you may sort numbers based on their spelling in a different language than English (as long as you submit English solution too). I won’t be able to check their correctness, but appreciate those submissions too.
